					<p>ADA <strong>Skepsis</strong>. A Cardano Staking Pool.<br />
					"Skepsis" is the Ancient Greek word for reasoning, thinking.</p>
					<p>ADA Skepsis is a staking pool whose primary objective is spreading blockchain technology and especially the <strong>Cardano network</strong> into
					the Academic community. Our pool is running on the <strong>Azure cloud</strong> which ensures a <strong>24/7 uptime</strong> and a <strong>neutral
					CO<sub>2</sub> footprint</strong>. We have implemented the most advanced multi-layered security features to protect our Virtual Machines.
					Our team consists of members from North America and Europe, which allows us to respond quicker than most other stake pools.
					We also bring expertise in Cloud computing, Machine Learning, Systems computing, and OS Security that contributes to the smooth 
					operation of the pool thus maximizing the profitability of your investments.</p>
					
                                        <p>As a first step we <strong>donate 10%</strong> of the pool&#39s profits to <strong>a student from NTUA</strong> (National Technical 
                                        University of Athens) with the most prominent research results in any of Cardano&#39s underlying protocols or in the general field of 
                                        blockchain technology.</p>

						<h2>What is Cardano?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Cardano is a blockchain platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries, with the tools and technologies required to create possibility for the many, as well as the few, and bring about positive global change. 
					Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.</p>

						<h2>What is Staking?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Cardano uses Ouroboros as its proof-of-stake protocol. 
					It distributes network control across stake pools: node operators with the infrastructure required to ensure a consistent and reliable connection to the network. 
					For each slot, a stake pool is assigned as the slot leader, and is rewarded for adding a block to the chain. 
					Ada holders may delegate their stake to a specific stake pool, increasing its chance of being selected as the slot leader, and share in the stake pool’s rewards.</p>

						<h2>Why Prefer Skepsis Pool?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>We are people with technical backgrounds and have the firm belief that technology can and should improve our lives. 
						We are strong believers of the success and mass acceptance of cryptocurrency and we support the Cardano network 
						especially because of its great community, underlying scientific foundation and vision. What better way to propagate 
						these ideas than through young, smart college students? Hence, we donate part of our profits to support at least 
						one student every year.</p>
					<p>We are also environmental sensitive and despise the huge amounts of energy consumed by the proof of work protocol 
						to maintain blockchains such as Bitcoin. It was a necessary evil to bring the cryptocurrency world here, 
						but we must evolve. We found Cardano&#39s Proof of Stake protocol Ouroboros appealing. Not only we do not have 
						racks of ASIC miners running but we host our 3 pool nodes on Virtual Machines on Microsoft&#39s Azure Cloud, which 
						has been CO<sub>2</sub> neutral since 2012. On top of that we have 0% tax on our delegator&#39s rewards, maximizing 
						their profits.</p>
