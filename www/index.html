Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.</h2>

            <h1>What is Staking?</h1> 
            <h2>Cardano uses Ouroboros as its proof-of-stake protocol. It distributes network control across stake pools: node operators with the infrastructure required to ensure a consistent and reliable connection to the network.
                For each slot, a stake pool is assigned as the slot leader, and is rewarded for adding a block to the chain. Ada holders may delegate their stake to a specific stake pool, increasing its chance of being selected as the slot leader, and share in the stake poolâ€™s rewards.</h2>
