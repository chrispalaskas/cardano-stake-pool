Load GParted as boot image
Don't touch keymap, continue to start X
Extend the primary to the unallocated partition, add linux-swap 2GB


To make the newly created partition faster:
cd /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d
sudo touch resume
sudo nano resume
Add this in the file: RESUME=none

sudo update-initramfs -u

sudo reboot

sudo blkid
Take the swap UUID and place it in file /etc/fstab 
so that it doesn't search for a string UUID that it will never find.
